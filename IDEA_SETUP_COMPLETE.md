# CHTL Compiler - IDEA Setup Complete

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed CHTLNodeVisitor Interface
- Created the missing `CHTLNodeVisitor` interface in the model package
- Updated all visitor method implementations to use the correct method names

### 2. Fixed Package Import Issues
- Fixed 75+ files where package declaration and import were on the same line
- Removed duplicate imports in AST node classes

### 3. Created Missing Classes
- Created `TemplateType` enum for template types
- Created `CustomType` enum for custom element types
- Created `SelectorType` enum for CSS selector types
- Created `ConstraintManager` with `ConstraintTarget` enum

### 4. Fixed Constructor Issues
- Added proper NodeType parameter to all CHTLJS node constructors
- Fixed AbstractCHTLASTNode constructor calls

### 5. Created IDEA Project Configuration
- Created `.idea` directory with complete project configuration
- Set up module configuration (chtl-compiler.iml)
- Configured Java 17 as the project SDK
- Configured library dependencies (ANTLR, SLF4J, Logback)
- Set up proper source folders and resource folders

## How to Open in IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**

2. **Open the Project**
   - Select "Open" from the welcome screen
   - Navigate to the `/workspace` directory
   - Click "OK"

3. **Configure JDK (if needed)**
   - Go to File → Project Structure → Project
   - Set Project SDK to Java 17 or higher
   - Set Language Level to 17

4. **Download Dependencies**
   - Create a `lib` directory in the project root
   - Download the following JARs and place them in the `lib` folder:
     - antlr4-runtime-4.13.1.jar
     - slf4j-api-2.0.9.jar
     - logback-classic-1.4.11.jar
     - logback-core-1.4.11.jar

5. **Build the Project**
   - Click Build → Rebuild Project
   - IDEA will compile all source files

## Remaining Issues to Fix

While the project structure is now set up for IDEA, there are still some compilation errors that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Context Classes**: Several classes reference `CompilationContext` which needs to be implemented
2. **Missing Scanner Classes**: References to `ScannerStateMachine` need to be resolved
3. **ANTLR Grammar**: The ANTLR grammar files need to be processed to generate parser/lexer classes

## Next Steps

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Let IDEA index the project
3. Use IDEA's error highlighting to identify and fix remaining compilation issues
4. Run the ANTLR plugin to generate parser classes from grammar files
5. Implement missing classes as identified by IDEA

The project is now ready to be opened in IntelliJ IDEA with a proper structure that will allow you to easily identify and fix the remaining issues using the IDE's features.
